Image Recognition using Machine Learning
This project is an image classification system powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to identify and categorize objects within images with high accuracy. By leveraging deep learning, the system automatically learns patterns, shapes, and features from the dataset without manual feature engineering.

The model is trained using a labeled dataset, where each image belongs to a specific category. To improve performance and generalization, the training pipeline includes image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) and data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming). Dropout regularization and optimization techniques are used to reduce overfitting and boost accuracy.

Users can upload an image or provide a live camera feed, and the system will predict the most likely category in real time. The application can be adapted for various use cases, including:

Automated quality control in manufacturing

Medical image diagnosis assistance

Wildlife species identification

Security and surveillance analytics
